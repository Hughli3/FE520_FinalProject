## 1. Topic (specify a problem you want to solve). You need to choose one topic from the Question List in the Modules.
Stock information web interface

## 2. Motivation and insights you expect from data analysis
We want to understand how the website is built and practice it. 
From another aspect, we want to learn and try how to apply data analysis on the data we fetched to see the trend of stock prices and any other possible insight.
## 3. Related work (Reference and what you have done before)
We were learning how to build a web server through web-resources and doing pre-research on related areas we needed such as how to build frontend, backend. We also did some research on Mysql and tried to understand how to use it to store and fetch data.
## 4. Possible methodology if you have some idea (optional)
Use some stock indicator, such as RSI, KDG and MACD, to tell the user buy or sell the stock.
## 5. Project plan: list the tasks you need to take to complete the project.
